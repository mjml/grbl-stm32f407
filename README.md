# grbl for STM32F407

This project is a direct fork of classic gnea/grbl, but I'm modifying it to work on an STM32F407ZETG board that I got from AliExpress.

Running at 168MHz, it will provide faster pulse rates to work with larger Leadshine stepper drivers.

It will also allow me to add facilities for an ATC spindle, customizable lighting, and maybe a speaker for audible alerts during jobs.

If you're interested, I'll be blogging about it on my website at http://www.michaeljoya.com/
