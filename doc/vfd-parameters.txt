PD000: Parameter lock
Factory: 0
Desired: 0

PD001: Source of commands
Factory: 0
Factory: ?
Desired: 1 (External Terminal / Multi-input pins)


PD002: Source of operating frequency
Factory: 0
Factory: ?
Desired: 1 (External Terminal / VI / AI)
         Signal type determined by PD070
Notes: net claims that Shapeoko uses a PWM signal for this.
       Don't forget to use a nice mica capacitor to filter it.         

PD003: Main frequency
Factory: 50 or 0
Factory: ?
Desired: 100 (6000 rpm)
Notes: The speed will be set by VI, but I set this to 6krpm so that the spindle obtains
       this distinctively low speed if the VI circuitry and setting is being ignored 
       (in favour of this setting for some reason).
       This value is also "safe" for all spindles according to various internet testimonies.
         
PD004: Base frequency
Factory: 50
Factory: ?
Desired: 400
Notes: supported by spindle motor, also internet claims

PD005: Max. operating frequency
Factory: 50
Factory: ?
Desired: 400

PD006: Intermediate frequency
Factory: 2.50 
Desired: 80
Notes: This midpoint provides predictable linear performance over the upper part
       of the instrumentation / power output range. 
       At 220V = m * 400Hz, (m=0.55V/Hz), the midpoint is 44V = m * 80Hz
       
PD007: Min frequency
Factory: 0.5
Desired: 0.5
Notes: At this setting, we'd be applying 22V using the linear scale.
       I bump this up to 25V below.
       I suppose this setting might be useful for large diameter bits/mills on wood.

PD008: Max voltage
Factory: 220V/380V
Desired: 220V 

PD009: Intermediate voltage
Factory: 21 (range is 0.15-100V ?)
Desired: 50

PD010: Min. voltage
Factory: 10.5
Desired: 10.5

PD011: Frequency lower limit (safety limit?)
Factory: 100
Notes: This is 25% power, or 55V. At maximum cut-off current of 7A,
       this would produce 385W of power. I think this is sufficient for "small"
       stainless steel jobs.

PD013: Parameter reset
Factory: 0
Desired: 0
Note: set to 1 for abnormal parameter detected

PD014: Accel time 1
Factory: 15
Desired: 4
Note: Since I'm not using heavy bits nor starting the bit in stock, 
      a shorter ramp-up time is fine.
      Also: carbide3d posting used this with a 220V spindle

PD015: Decel time 1
Factory: 15
Desired: 6
Note: As above.

PD016-PD021: are repetitions of 014 and 015 for 3 other different numbered profiles (2,3,4)
PD022: Reserved

PD023: Rev rotation select
Factory: 0
Desired: 0
Note: Allow reverse rotation of the motor

PD024: STOP key
Factory: 1
Desired: 1
Note: Stop key on the front panel is valid.

PD025: Starting mode
Factory: 0
Desired: 1
Note: Do not apply DC braking to start -- track starting frequency in case of a "hot start"

PD026: Stopping mode
Factory: 0
Desired: 0
Note: Use DC braking once the stopping frequency has been attained.
      Make sure to connect the braking resistor!
      
PD028: Starting frequency
Factory: 0.5
Desired: 0.5

PD029: DC Braking time at start
Factory: 0.0
Desired: 0.0 (not applicable since PD025=1)

PD030: DC Braking time at stop
Factory: 2.0
Desired: 2.0

PD031: DC Braking voltage level
Factory: 2.0%
Desired: 2.0%
Notes: I'd like to experiment with higher values. The default seems low (control freq of 8Hz)

PD032: Frequency track time
Factory: 5.0
Desired: 3.0
Notes: I think 3.0s should be sufficient.

PD033: Current level for frequency track
Factory: 150
Note: I think this is an overcurrent threshold for when the detected current is larger
      than what the control frequency should dictate. When exceeded,
      the VFD will scale back the control frequency.
      I just leave this at default.

PD034: Inverter track time 
Factory: 0.5
Note: I found this to be confusing and am leaving it at default.
      A higher setting is supposed to account for high power machines which need to be tracked
      at a higher "up" voltage (?).

PD035: Reserved

PD041: Carrier frequency
Factory: 5 (4kHz)
Desired: 5 to start, I will experiment with a higher value later.
Note: Since I'm powering a 1.5kW spindle with a 2.2kW ac drive, I should be able to accomodate
      the heat / stress on the drive due to a higher frequency. 
      Recall that this line of VFDs goes down to 400W.
      Note: cnczone peeps have tried 
      
PD042: Jogging frequency
Factory: 5.0
Desired: 5.0
Note: I'm not sure I'd even use this. Might be useful for cleaning the bit. 
      Leaving it at default
      
PD043: S-Curve time
Factory: 1.0
Desired: 6

## Multi-input function definitions
## I'm not sure what the last three defaults do.
## Some of the default values over 16 are confusing to me.

PD044: FOR(D1) function
Factory: 02 (forward rotation)

PD045: REV(D2) function
Factory: 03 (reverse rotation)

PD046: RST(D3) function

PD047: SPH(D4) function
