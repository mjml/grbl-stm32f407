Immediate errors / differences from grbl:

Certain hardware macros are missing:
  SPINDLE_PWM_DDR
  SPINDLE_PWM_BIT
  SPINDLE_TCCRA_REGISTER / SPINDLE_TCCRA_INIT_MASK
  SPINDLE_TCCRB_REGISTER / SPINDLE_TCCRB_INIT_MASK
  SPINDLE_DIRECTION_DDR / SPINDLE_DIRECTION_BIT
  SPINDLE_PWM_RANGE
  SPINDLE_COMB_BIT
  SPINDLE_PWM_MAX_VALUE
  SPINDLE_PWM_MIN_VALUE
  SPINDLE_DIRECTION_PORT

grbl {
    The spindle always has (at least) an enable pin.
    Woodpecker uses this on/off single-direction configuration on B3(D11).
    However, grbl code allows for a dir pin as well, and a variable speed option.

    The standard cases go:
        Enable only: ena on B4/D12
        Enable on B4/D12, dir on B5/D13
        Variable speed pwm on B3/D11, ena on B5/D13 
          * (Woodpecker's suspected config, but they just wire B5/D13 to one of the expansion terminal pins. It is used as a SCK when updating firmware.
        Variable speed pwm on B3/D11, dir on B5/D13

    This is defined as VARIABLE_SPINDLE but not USE_SPINDLE_DIR_AS_ENABLE_PIN.

    In a dual-axis setup, there is no spindle direction control nor coolant mist pins.

    A variable-speed spindle has an associated PWM timer.

    The output pin is controlled directly by the timer circuitry rather than manually (classic PWM).

mm {
    There is no alarm port or functionality.
    There are no databus pins to program a VFD -- it would have to be done manually.

    Best would be variable speed on B3, ena on B5, no direction.
